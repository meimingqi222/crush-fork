[CRITICAL WARNING]
Do NOT call this tool unless you have actually spawned background subagents using the `agent` tool first. This tool is ONLY for communicating with running background subagents. It CANNOT be used to communicate with the user, nor can it be used if no subagents are currently running in the background.

Sends a control message to a running task graph, or queues a follow-up prompt
for a background agent.

Use this tool when you need to notify another task (or all tasks) during agent
delegation, or when you want a background agent to continue working after it
finishes its current run. If no mailbox_id is provided, the current task graph
mailbox from context is used automatically.

Parameters:
- agent_id (optional): Background agent ID or name to continue with a follow-up prompt. You can use either the agent ID (e.g., "a-abc123") or a human-readable name (e.g., "researcher-xyz").
- mailbox_id (optional): Mailbox identifier to deliver messages to. If omitted, defaults to the current task graph mailbox from context.
- message (required): Message content to enqueue.
- task_id (optional): Target task ID. Omit to broadcast to all tasks in the mailbox.

Targeting rules and precedence:
- If `agent_id` is provided, the message targets that background agent and `mailbox_id`/`task_id` are ignored.
- If `agent_id` is omitted, `mailbox_id` + optional `task_id` target task-graph mailbox delivery.
- If only `mailbox_id` is provided, message is broadcast in that mailbox.
- If both `mailbox_id` and `task_id` are provided, message is sent only to that task.
- If neither `agent_id` nor `mailbox_id` is provided, the current delegation mailbox from context is used.
- If `task_id` is provided while both `agent_id` and `mailbox_id` are omitted, the message targets that task in the context default mailbox.

Examples:
- Background agent by name: `{ "agent_id": "researcher", "message": "continue investigation" }`
- Background agent by id: `{ "agent_id": "a-abc123", "message": "run extra tests" }`
- Mailbox broadcast: `{ "mailbox_id": "mb-1", "message": "sync status" }`
- Mailbox targeted task: `{ "mailbox_id": "mb-1", "task_id": "task-a", "message": "retry with logs" }`

Notes:
- Agents can be addressed by name or ID. Name-based addressing makes it easier to continue specific agents without tracking random IDs.
- Prefer `agent_id` for resumable background agents and `mailbox_id` for task graph coordination.
- Messages are delivered best-effort while the mailbox is active.
- Unknown mailbox, agent, or task IDs return an error response.
- If an agent is still running, the message is queued and delivered on its next turn.
- Attempts to send `agent_id` messages to stopped or non-resumable agents return an error. The subagent should use the `yield` tool to submit its complete result before finishing.
